# Animated Calculator
# you can view the full project in the master branch
This repository contains a Java program for an animated calculator GUI. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, mathematical functions, constants, and more.

## Features:
- Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus
- Mathematical Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Cotangent, Arcsine, Arccosine, Arctangent, Hyperbolic Functions, Logarithms, Exponentials, Factorials
- Constants: Pi (Ï€), Euler's Number (e), Logical AND Operator (bitwise)
- Interactive GUI: User-friendly interface for input and output

## Usage:
1. **Compile and Run**: Compile the Java source code and run the `AnimatedCalculator` class to launch the calculator GUI.
   
2. **Input Expression**: Enter mathematical expressions using buttons provided on the GUI. Click "Clear" to clear the input field, and "Delete" to delete the last character.

3. **Evaluate Expression**: Press "=" to evaluate the entered expression. The result will be displayed in the input field.

4. **Functions and Constants**: Mathematical functions and constants can be used directly in expressions. For example, "sin(30)", "pi", "exp(2)", etc.

5. **Error Handling**: The calculator handles various errors, such as division by zero, invalid input, etc., and displays appropriate messages.

## Notes:
- This calculator uses infix to postfix conversion and stack-based evaluation to handle complex expressions efficiently.
- It supports a wide range of mathematical functions and operations, making it useful for scientific calculations.

## Dependencies:
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Swing Library (Included in standard JDK)
